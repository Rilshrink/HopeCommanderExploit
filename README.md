## HopeCommander Authentication Exploit

README Based on https://github.com/ParadoxLegit/AuthMeBridge-Exploit

### Details: 
**Severity**: High

**Discovery Date**: 6 January, 2021

**Public** 8 January, 2021

### Vulnerability Scope
This vulnerability affects all servers running HopeCommander.

### Description
An attacker can run any command that is supported by the Bungee console such as luck perms and give themselves all perms.

### Reproduction
This is pretty simple to reproduce just send a custom payload using the hope:hopecmdsend channel and the command as the payload in the form of a UTF.

### Mitigation
if(event.getSender() instanceof ProxiedPlayer) return; 
can be added when reading the channel.

### The End?
This is a relatively unknown plugin so the chances of a attacker using this is rare.
(Edit)
Seems this has been patched with an IP-Whitelist system instead of just checking if a player or the server is sending it. There are ways an attacker can spoof his ip to a bungeecord still.
